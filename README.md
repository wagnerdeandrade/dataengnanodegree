# Data Engineering Nanodegree
Udacity Data Engineering nanodegree exercises and projects


## With regards to the exercises

Although you can use the Udacity Data Engineering nanodegree workspace, for the sake of keeping exercise notebooks organized with my course notes under Google Drive I decided to:
1. Download the workspace .ipynb files;
2. Upload into my Google Drive account;
3. Set up the local tools (Jupiter, Apache Cassandra, PostgreSQL...);
4. Connect local Jupiter to Google Colab;
5. Run the exercises into Google Colab;
