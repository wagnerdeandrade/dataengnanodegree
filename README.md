# Data Engineering Nanodegree
The Udacity [Data Engineering nanodegree (up to september 2020)](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) is basically composed of 5 modules.<br>
In each of the four first modules a key Data Engineering concept is introduced through video lectures, some exercises demanded and a final project to demonstrate the acquired knowledge is required.<br>
The fifth module is a Capstone project were you must combine the acquired knowledge in a self chosen/designed project.    

## Module exercises and projects
1. [Data Modeling](https://github.com/wagnerdeandrade/dataengnanodegree/tree/master/1.%20Data%20Modeling)
2. [Data Warehouses - Redshift](https://github.com/wagnerdeandrade/dataengnanodegree/tree/master/2.%20Data%20Warehouses)
3. [Data Lakes - S3 Parquet & Spark](https://github.com/wagnerdeandrade/dataengnanodegree/tree/master/3.%20Data%20Lakes%20-%20Spark)
4. [Data Pipelines - Airflow ](https://github.com/wagnerdeandrade/dataengnanodegree/tree/master/4.%20Data%20Pipelines%20-%20Airflow)
5. [Capstone Project](https://to.go)

### Exercises note
Many exercises (specially in the first modules) are in Jupyter notebooks. <br>
Although you could use the Udacity Data Engineering nanodegree workspace you can also execute it locally or even use Google Colab and keep the notebooks together with your course notes in Google Drive like:
1. Set up the local tools (Jupiter, Apache Cassandra, PostgreSQL...);
2. Get the necessary tools up (make sure that Jupyter instance can be remotelly acessed);
3. Download the workspace .ipynb files (exercise notebook);
4. Upload the notebook into your Google Drive account;
5. Open the exercise notebook using Google Colab;
6. Connect Google Colab opened notebook with your local environment;
7. Run the exercises into Google Colab;
